Customer Churn Prediction Analyses (cases of Telecom )
Here we will have Customer Churn Prediction Analyses (cases of Telecom )

Introduction

In this blog post, we will explore a telecom customer dataset using Python to derive insights and make data-driven decisions. Following the CRISP-DM process, we will go through the main steps of a data science project to analyze customer behavior and preferences in the telecom industry. 
What can influence the customer churn in the telecom industry?
Is there a link between customer recharge and churn?
is the model can help to take the decision for customer churn?
In the context of churn prediction in a telecom company, the objectives of the data collection effort could be defined as follows:

Reduce Customer Churn: The primary objective is to identify factors that contribute to customer churn and develop strategies to reduce churn rates. This involves understanding why customers are leaving the service and what can be done to retain them.

Identify Churn Predictors: Determine which customer attributes and behaviors are predictive of churn. This could include variables such as usage patterns, account tenure, service plan details, customer demographics, customer support interactions, and billing history.

We have used a telecom dataset from the internet for doing our analyses.
